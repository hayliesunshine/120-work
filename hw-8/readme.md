## Weekly Report

This week I went through everything on the website and did the linked readings, as well as watched the videos. I paid careful attention to the meaning of each of the slots in the for function. To complete the assignment, I decided to make repeating rectangles to form a banner. I created a for loop for the rectangles, and made it so there would not be any space between each rectangle, and that they would flash random colors. I did not have any problems this week, and did not need to post into the issues forum. I had been wondering about the difference between let and var, and why let didn't work for me in several of my sketches. The content on that this week was clarifying.
