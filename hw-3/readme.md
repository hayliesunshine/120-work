# Weekly Review

This week went much more smoothly for me than last week did. I was able to figure out what I was doing without the help of the issues forum efficiently. I learned about functions, parameters, strings, and some of the background of p5.js. This involved making my own Hello World page, and publishing it to my website as a live link.
My favorite thing I did this week, as simple as it is, was changing the background colors of my canvas. Who would've thought that it could recognize beige, turqoise, and maroon, but not mint?
This week I did not help with the issues forum, mainly because I super busy this week and ended up doing a good portion of this right away when it was posted, and the rest of it the night before it was due.
This week made me excited about the possibilities for web design and art that I could learn to create with p5.js.
