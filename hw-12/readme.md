## Homework 12

This week I went over all of the content, and also went back to last weeks content and went over that a second time. I was able to do most of my sketch, but when I got to the point where I needed the objects to be aware of each other I got really confused. Luckily, I had an appointment with Professor Musick to go over some stuff, so he was able to walk me through it. Essentially what needed to happen was that I needed to compare one bubble to "other bubble," instead of only two bubbles doing any checking. I think after my time with Professor Musick today, I have a better grasp of what is going on.
