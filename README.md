Finding a picture of the top view of a plain bathtub that didn't have a bunch of extra stuff going on and was a nice looking tub was more difficult than I anticipated, but I have a tub I'm satisfied with. I took it into Photoshop and created a black background for it, and filled it with opaque water. I then brought it into my sketch as the background. As far as I can tell, my syntax for this is correct and I did the load image and global variable definition, but when I try to preview it in Chrome it says "Loading..." at the top left of the browser screen, so I might need to do some debugging there. Right now I am working on changing my bubble class from our last homework to fit my needs for this bubble bath. Once I have done that, I will work on putting the class into the draw function, and I will need to figure out the locations of the borders of the tub so that the bubbles stay within it. 


I ended up ditching the bubbles, because no matter what I tried I couldn't get them to work with my sketch without it breaking my code. However, I was able to get the music going after a lot of trial and error. I did a lot of research about how I could do a music visualization with the water of the tub, but ended up choosing not go with that, as I wanted my sketch to remain simple. The entire purpose of this sketch was for it to be calming, so I thought less would be more. I put text prompts on the page, and made candles to go on the edge of the tub, with the music on loop.

This whole process overall took an estimated 12 hours. I was looking at my classmates' codes and projects, and it appears many of them were probably able to accomplish more in the same amount of time as me. However, this project took a lot of effort, frustration, research, and problem solving for me, so I am happy to have the finished project that I do have. If nothing else, it is something that I would actually use that met my original goal of creating something that could be helpful for people with anxiety disorders.
