## Weekly Report

This week, I explored the code necessary for drawing in p5.js, including drawing shapes, points, lines, and filling with color or doing stroke colors and weights. I revisited the concept of a grid. I also learned how to translate my objects, which was fairly easy for me to pick up on since I already understood this concept from CAD. 
To complete the assignment, I first drew out a rough sketch in my journal, then thought about the order of operations I would need to follow to create my various layers in a functional way. I also thought about what shapes I would need to combine to create the shapes I needed, like an ellipse and a rectangle for my hair, and lines and points for my limbs and joints. I then drew my code, and created a design of stripes to go on my shirt. 
The only problem that I had was that at first, none of my code was working besides my background for my canvas, and I couldn't figure out why. It turned out to be that I was missing a curly bracket. I didn't look at the issue tracker until pretty late in the week, and at that point everything looked to be resolved.
The one thing that I would like to further explore is whether or not you can make it so you can visually see the grid, since I spent a lot of time guessing and reworking where to place my objects.
