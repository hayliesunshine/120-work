Finding a picture of the top view of a plain bathtub that didn't have a bunch of extra stuff going on and was a nice looking tub was more difficult than I anticipated, but I have a tub I'm satisfied with. I took it into Photoshop and created a black background for it, and filled it with opaque water. I then brought it into my sketch as the background. As far as I can tell, my syntax for this is correct and I did the load image and global variable definition, but when I try to preview it in Chrome it says "Loading..." at the top left of the browser screen, so I might need to do some debugging there. Right now I am working on changing my bubble class from our last homework to fit my needs for this bubble bath. Once I have done that, I will work on putting the class into the draw function, and I will need to figure out the locations of the borders of the tub so that the bubbles stay within it.
