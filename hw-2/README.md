# Weekly Report, September 6

## Questions
### 1. Summarize the work you did. Pay particular attention to the individual choices you made.
    - I had downloaded Atom and Github last week, but this week I got them up and running, and explored each of them. I personally chose to create my repositories and navigate around Github before looking at the instructions on the class page, just to see what I could figure out on my own. Atom I did not, because I didn't understand the layout as well when I originally opened it. I made multiple new files, and pushed my repository to [Github.com] (https://github.com/hayliesunshine/120-work).

### 2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?
    - To complete the assignment, I followed the directions for each section, and then took some time to play around and figure things out on my text editor and Github. This entailed making my 120-work repository, the hw-2 directory, test2 file, README file, and editing my test1 file.

### 3. Did you have any problems? How did you solve these? Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker? Did you receive any helpful feedback from your peers?
    - The only problem I had is that I thought the homework was due on Sunday, because of what I read in the syllabus and last week's information. However, assignments are apparently due on Thursdays. This meant that I had to cram most of the week's worth of work into a short period of time to get it done on time. I did not post to the issue tracker about it, as I figured it out on my own.
    - Update: I started to have problems once I wrote this report. The codes aren't translating when I push the file to my repository online, or when I preview them in the text editor. I posted on the issue tracker, and am waiting for help from my classmates. Meanwhile, I have been searching online trying to figure out what the problem is. My screenshot isn't showing up as well. 

### 4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?
      - I don't necessarily need to discuss it further, but after this week's work I feel a lot more comfortable with the programs that we will be using. I felt overwhelmed and confused last week, but I think I am getting the hang of it after doing the exercises this week. However, in particular I did learn how to **bold** things, which I am particularly excited about for some reason. I can do this by doing the following:
      ```
      **bold**
      ```
### 5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
    - I did not assist on any issues this week.
