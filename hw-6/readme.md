* Weekly Report

This week I learned about math in p5, as well as objects, algorithms, and random number generators. I read various sources about these, thoroughly read the code examples, and watched videos about them. 
To complete the assignment, I took ideas from different examples that were given in the lesson, and thought of a way to combine them to create my own thing. I decided to make randomly appearing and randomly colored rings that are constrained to the inside of a circle. I wrote the code for this, occasionally looking at the website for help.
As I was writing the code, I felt confident and didn't feel that I was having any problems. I forgot how to write a certain line a few times, but was fine once I was looked back to the lesson. However, when I went to actually run the code, nothing showed up. There were two error messages, both about an uncaught reference error. My problem was that I couldn't figure out hwo to fix this. I googled and the results I could find told me to define my variable outside and inside of setup, so I did that, but nothing changed. I posted to the issues forum, and am waiting on a response. Hopefully somebody else will know what it means.
I am confused by the concept of mapping, and what the syntax means when defining the map. I will need to look into that further.
