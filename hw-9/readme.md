This week I went through the content on the site and took detailed notes to learn about functions. When I did my assignment, it went fairly well. The stars appeared nicely, and I initially had a problem with getting my text to show up. However, I asked questions on the issues forum and eventually resolved the issue. I wanted to add in a planet function as well as the star function, but something funky was happening when I put it into draw. I am still figuring out why that is happening. I think functions are definitely helpful to avoid the redudancy that can happen in code.
