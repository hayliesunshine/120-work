# Week 11

## [Live link](https://hayliesunshine.github.io/120-work/hw-10)

I really like the concept of this week of object oriented programming. I think that once I get the hang of it, it will be very useful and time saving. However, at the moment, nothing about my code is working. The concept itself is fairly simple: create a class that is abstract and can contain any categories of objects you may make in the future. Then, make objects that fall into the classes. When I put this into practice, however, I am getting error codes that tell me I cannot use 'class' in p5.js, which makes no sense, since that is the point of this entire week.
Don has been helping me this week in the issues forum, and I have seen that multiple other people are having the same problem as me that nothing will show up from their sketch. I have been watching his responses to them as well, trying to apply what he suggests to my sketch. I also searched around on the internet and on the p5 reference site, but to no avail. 
This week has been frustrating for me, because when I was watching the videos and going over the content, I thought I understood. In practice, I am finding that there are many things that are not working.
