#Proposal
I want to create a zen-type interactive image of a bathtub, in which the user can use the mouse to move around bubbles within the walls of the tub. At the same time, I want calming music to start playing as soon as the sketch begins.

##Inspiration
I originally got this idea because I really liked the sketch that was in the past examples section of the content that had the fireflies. It was really beautiful and calming, and as somebody who deals with anxiety it seemed like a good idea to create a sketch that could help with that.

##Anticipated Challenges
At the moment, I don't know how to include music in a sketch, so that will be a learning curve for me. I also want the sketch to be continuous as long as the browser is open, so I will need to figure out how to loop the song once it hits its ending point.

##Work Plan
By Wednesday, November 28, I will have the sketch completed to a point where everything that I am going to include is in its place, which means that by Monday at the latest I should have the music thing figured out. By December 1, I should have it debugged and ready to submit.
In order to get the work done, I will set aside thirty minutes a day to work on it.

##Work Completed
I have not completed as much work this week as I would have liked. I have been looking for background images that I will be able to use the clear parameters of the edges of the tub as boundaries for bubbles. Before this, I spent A LOT of time thinking about what my project would be. I thought about making an interactive world map with country capitals, and read some codes from people who had done similar sketches, but I didn't know what a lot of their code meant, so I figured I should take a pass on that.
